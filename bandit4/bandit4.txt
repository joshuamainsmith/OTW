Enter the directory named

inhere

Once in, you'll notice that there are 10 files with a similar name.

We could type

more ./-file0x (where x ranges from 0-9)

But this would be time consuming and boring.

Instead, I've included a Python script that outputs the contents of all the files included in the directory.

To use the script, type

python

into the terminal.

Copy the script to the terminal, then press enter.

You'll notice that File 07 has a string of letters and numbers that look like previous keys we've found.

This key is used to enter bandit5.
